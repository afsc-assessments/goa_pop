0
# srr_prior - Condition that there is a prior that mean historical recruitment is similar to expected recruitment at half mean SSB and double mean SSB 0 means don't use, otherwise specify CV
0
# write_big - Flag to write big file (of all simulations rather than a summary, 0 means don't do it, otherwise do it)
