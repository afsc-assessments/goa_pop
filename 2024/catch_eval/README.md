To address the September 2024 Harvest Projections email (2025-02-07): 

Hi all,

We have compiled a list of the September 2024 harvest projections, the associated projected 2024 catches assumed, and the 2025 ABC recommendations, to compare with harvest projection outcomes using actual reported total 2024 catches here. We are asking authors of 2024 harvest projections to please rerun your projection model with the full year reported catch for 2024.

The attached spreadsheet lists the stocks which provided harvest projections for 2024, the estimated 2024 catch used in the projection, the recommended ABC from the accepted (Oct. 2024 SSC meeting) 2024 harvest projection, and the reported full year 2024 reported catch (through December 31, 2024). 
Please check these values for your stock
Please rerun the harvest projection replacing the estimated 2024 catch with the official reported 2024 catch
Please enter the catch advice (ABC) from the updated (February 2025) harvest projection
Please enter the maxABC from the 2024 harvest projection run.
We appreciate your help with this to assess the efficiency of submitting harvest projections at the September Groundfish Plan Team meetings for SSC approval at the October SSC meetings. We need to confirm that this satisfies using the best available scientific information. Please fill in the spreadsheet by COB Thursday, February 27, 2025

Please contact Sandra if you have any questions.

Chris, Melissa, Pat, and Sandra
