# Appendix 10c: Summary of the 2021 CIE review of Gulf of Alaska Pacific Ocean perch {#appxcie}

The Center for Independent Expert (CIE) review for Gulf of Alaska Pacific ocean perch was conducted virtually from March 30 to April 1, 2021. The panel of experts consisted of Drs Noel Cadigan, Saang-Yoon Hyun, and Geoff Tingley. Overall, the review was productive, resulting in a number of recommendations for future development and research into the assessment for GOA POP. By the conclusion of the review the experts found the assessment to be of high quality, and the reviews contained statements like, “The overall outcome of this assessment, as reviewed, is that it meets the description of best available science and exceeds the acceptability quality threshold to be used to inform management.” (Tingley).

Each of the reviewers provided research recommendations that should serve to improve the assessment model for GOA POP. A number of the recommendations focused on a variety of sensitivity analyses, while others involved more in-depth model development. Distilling these comments, the more in-depth recommendations included:

+ Investigate data weighting of compositional data
+ Develop a state-space model to be run in parallel to the current assessment
+ Continue to investigate use of VAST estimates of survey biomass, in particular investigate reasons behind the divergence between design-based and model-based estimates of abundance

As it pertains to the use of VAST estimates of survey biomass, the consensus among the reviewers was that it is still premature to use this index in the assessment until it can be more thoroughly investigated. This was also the consensus with the use of acoustic survey biomass estimates as an additional index to the model. Due to the recommendations that further work be conducted before implementation into the assessment, and in conjunction with the work that the AFSC internal review team performed through 2020 and 2021 (which additionally identified different methods to estimate fishery selectivity as a topic to be considered in the assessment model development), the GOA POP assessment will not incorporate any substantial model changes for the 2021 assessment cycle, but will investigate and continue to develop these various recommendations to be potentially implemented in the next full assessment that will be conducted in 2023.

Tables 10.\@ref(tab:cietor1) through 10.\@ref(tab:cietor5) compile the main recommendations suggested by the reviewers and are organized by the terms of reference (TOR) of the review. A subset of these recommendations were addressed for this Update, and responses to those requests or comments follow the tables.

## Responses to Selected CIE Comments from Spring 2021

## Alternative Catch Histories
Tingley: *"Sensitivities to plausible alternative catch histories, particularly for the early years of the fishery, should be run, but only when there are substantive changes to the assessment model structure or major assumptions."*

**Response:** Revisiting the historical catch reconstruction would be onerous given that no new historical data sources have emerged since this review, and there is little complementary data (aside from the length compositions) for the early period of the model to corroborate any alternative trajectories. 

To address this comment, we leveraged the fact that the base model already separates the data weights assigned to the early (pre-1977) and late (1977-2021) catch time series. In the base model, these series are weighted identically. We explored alternative weights for the early time series of 20%, 50%, and 150% of the value used in the base model, effectively investigating the impacts of reducing or increasing the certainty of this data source. The terminal spawning and total biomass estimates from these models ranged by less than 10%. As expected, the early series and uncertainty thereof affects the model's estimate of initial and unfished biomass, with less certain (down-weighted) trajectories resulting in slightly higher estimates of these values (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:biomassearlycatch)).

There were two additional sensitivities run (results not shown) that provide further insight into this topic. Firstly, a sensitivity where the model begins during the "late" period (1975) -- ignoring all data (catches & lengths) from the early catch period -- resulted in a population trajectory nearly five times as high as the base model (in terms of total and summary biomass). A separate model run where the early length composition data were dropped, but the historical catches and model start year were the same as the base model, resulted in a perception of unfished biomass that was ~50% higher than the base model, though the population trajectory from ~1975 to present was nearly the same as the base model. 

These findings suggest that there is indeed information contained within the early catch series regarding model scale, particularly when contextualized by the early length composition data. Reducing the weight of these data results in qualitatively similar population trajectories, with slightly higher notions of unfished biomass; ignoring these data completely result in a much higher perception of stock size. Given these findings, revisiting the historical catch reconstruction is unlikely to be an influential exercise at this time.

## Plus Group
Tingley: *"Prior to or as part of the next assessment, explore whether the plus group should continue to start at age 25 or whether an older plus group starting age is more appropriate."*

This sensitivity has been explored in previous assessments, and was revisited in a run of the Stock Synthesis version of this model (described below) where the plus group was started at age 29. Model impacts were trivial.

## Stock Weights-at-Age in Survey vs Fishery
Cadigan: *"Investigate if stock weights-at-age from the survey are significantly (i.e., in the statistical sense) different than fishery weights-at-age. Also, investigate if there is significant temporal variation in both stock and fishery weights-at-age. Provide figures of how mean weight-at-age changes over time, with different panels for groups of ages (i.e., 1-5, 6-10, 10+). Consider using more efficient and less bias methods for analyzing size-at-age from length-stratified age samples (e.g., Perreault et al., 2019). Investigate spatiotemporal variation in weight as a function of length."*

The base model currently uses two size-at-age matrices that represent the probability of a fish of size $l$ being age $a$ for either an early (pre 1980's) or late (1980-present) period; both matrices were derived using survey data. Similarly, a single weight-at-age vector developed using survey data is applied to the entire population.

We have previously evaluated time-dependence in size-at-age, and have also previously compared sizes-at-age between the survey and fishery. This analysis is limited by the fact that age records are more sparsely sampled both through time and in terms of overall numbers than the survey (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:compobs)), which impacts the amount of data available to inform the construction of a separate size-at-age key for the fishery . 


To address this comment, we undertook two investigations. First, we ran a model using the original survey-based weight at age vector, but included a new size-at-age matrix for the fishery data only from 1980 onwards. This matrix was defined using the fishery data only, and is more certain as it includes more data from the entire age spectrum (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:sizeage)). This means that fish of all ages, but particularly adults, are more likely to be assigned a length of below 42 cm than the survey-derived matrix would suggest.

The weight-at-age relationship developed using fishery data alone suggests adult fish (ages 20+) to be at a smaller weight in the fishery than in the survey (averaging 742 grams in the fishery vs 891 grams in the survey, Figure 10.\@ref(fig:waacompare)). This would be consistent with discrepancies in selectivity, targeted harvesting, or un-modeled aspects of fisher behavior, *or* could be an artifact of sampling differences between fleets.

Use of this matrix results in slightly lower biomass trajectories (blue line, Figure 10.\@ref(fig:waacie1)), consistent with the notion that the fishery-derived size-at-age matrix assumes a lower probability of larger lengths-at-age.

Separately, we investigated the application of the fishery-derived *weight*-at-age vector (shown in pink in Figure 10.\@ref(fig:waacompare))). For this sensitivity, the weight-at-age vector was simply replaced with the new values. The biomass trajectory, particularly for spawning biomass, was nearly identical to the base case, much moreso than the sensitivity using the separate size-at-age matrices (green line, Figure 10.\@ref(fig:waacie1)). 

This suggests that derived quantities in this model are less sensitive to the weight-at-age parameters than they are to relationship between length and age, and the uncertainty thereof. We believe the survey to be a well-sampled representation of the pouplation, and the associated size-at-age matrix to better represent uncertainty in the growth process for this stock. In this model, this relationship is governed by the size-at-age matrices discussed above, but would be reasonably addressed in a new framework that allows for estimation of von Bertalanffy growth parameters within the model (and the associated variation across ages, or through time).

## Natural Mortality

Tingley TOR 1: *"Exploration of additional information to better define the realistic range of M for Pacific ocean perch is recommended. This should consider data available for Pacific ocean perch and for other long-lived rockfish species."*

Tingley TOR 3: *"In the absence of better information about the likely magnitude of M, sensitivities using values of fixed M that bracket the estimated value M should be run in future stock assessments to inform on the level of risk inherent in the current assumptions about M."*

There has been a fair amount of investigation on this topic; the following response is meant to succintly describe our findings and is organized into the principal lenses through which $M$ was explored in the POP model: through the priors, through likelihood profiles, and through the application of a new modeling framework.

## Priors on M

The Hamel (2015) prior was used for $M$ in 2020. The base case model uses a restrictive prior defined via $M \sim N(0.0614,0.00614)$ (a 10% coefficient of variation). 

The FishLife R package (Thorson et al., 2023) was recently updated to incorporate morphometric, spawning, behavioral, reproductive and trophic traits from a global database of fish life-history ("FishBase"). This tool enables us to develop a prior for $M$ for POP informed by similar species, and to better account for uncertainty. The prior suggested by the FishLife R package (version `3.0.0`) is broader and centered at a higher value (0.0939) than the the prior mean and posterior estimate of $M$ from the base model (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:mposterior)). 

A sensitivity run using the FishLife prior resulted in an even higher estimate of $M$ at `0.149622`, near the upper limit of our ecological understanding of this species (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:mposterior)). The biomass trajectories from this model (using the broader prior) are much higher than the base model (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:newmbiomass)), and the overall NLL from this sensitivity is 10 units lower than the base model (250.473 vs 260.057 units). The fits to the survey are not visually improved, though the time series of expected survey values is smoother (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:newmsurvfits)).


### Likelihood Profiles on M

We profiled over values of $M$ from 0.01 to 0.30 in increments of 0.02 using the base model from 2021.  (Profiles on $M$ have also been presented and discussed during the CIE and subsequent reviews of this model). This method involves fixing $M$ and removing the prior on $M$ from the total NLL calculation.  

In the absence of the prior, the total likelihood ("objective function", black line  in Figure 10.\@ref(fig:mprofilebase)) indicates that the MLE for $M$ would be much higher than it is in the base model, around 0.15, roughly consistent with the MLE found when the FishLife prior was used. The data likelihood component (red line in Figure 10.\@ref(fig:mprofilebase)) is otherwise the most well-defined and suggests an MLE for $M$ closer to 0.06, in agreement with the current prior mean, and consistent with where the base model estimates $M$ given the narrow prior and preponderance of information in the data. There was no statistical difference in the data likelihood component for models with $M$ values between 0.04 to 0.08.

The fishery size composition data appears to be in conflict with the fishery age composition and survey age and abundance data, whereby the former suggests $M$ values much higher than the latter, though both appear to minimize at values outside the tested realm (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:mprofilebase)). 

These observations suggest that the MLE indicated by the data likelihood and the curvature of that profile is probably a compromise between the data sources (survey abundance and ages, fishery ages, and maturity data) that suggest lower, more realistic values for $M$ (e.g., less than 0.10) and the one data source (fishery lengths) that suggests a high value for $M$. The influence of the fishery length data is reduced in the base model due to the inclusion of multiple other data sources and the specification of the narrow prior.

### Looking at M in a New Modeling Framework

The POP model was transitioned to the Stock Synthesis modeling framework (Methot and Wetzel [2013], `v3.30.17`). This was *not* undertaken as a full bridging exercise, rather as a learning tool to investigate whether certain issues in the POP model could be resolved or reproduced by changing or simplifying assumptions inherent to the bespoke model framework. This SS model was designed to 1) incorporate all the data that is currently used in the POP base model, 2) better account for uncertainty in key population dynamics processes, with the goal of 3) roughly match the scale and trend in derived quantities as the base model. *At present, we do not propose the SS model for management use and are not showing extensive model results here*.

$M$ is estimated in the SS model, using the broad FishLife prior described above (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:mposterior)). The other key differences between the 2021 base and SS model are that survey catchability is analytical, no size-at-age matrix is used (von Bertalanffy parameters are instead estimated, with attendant uncertainty), and there are no data weights applied (all data sources' contributions to the overall objective function are equally weighted, whereas the base model currently weights all data sources to "1" and the catch data to "50".)

Several useful findings emerged from this effort. Firstly, even in the precense of the broad FishLife prior, the SS model estimated $M$ to be just above 0.04 (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:mestimatess)). Recall that using the FishLife prior in the base model resulted in an estimate of $M$ to be nearly three times as high (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:mposterior)), which was corroborated by likelihood profiles on the base model (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:mprofilebase)). We suspect this difference is due to how selectivity is modeled, as the SS model estimates fishery selectivity to be nearly logistic (when allowed to estimate the descending limb of a double-normal curve), whereas the base model is controlled by the gamma function to be more traditionally dome-shaped. This would explain the need to constrain $M$ in the base model when the transition to gamma-shaped selectivity was made; the SS model assumes that older fish are indeed selected by the fishery, and there is information in the fishery and survey ages to suggest that $M$ is low.

We ran likelihood profiles on $M$ using the SS model to investigate whether similar patterns in data conflict persist across the two models (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:mprofiless)). The conflict between age and length (fishery) data persists; there is little information in the broad FishLife prior, as expected, and the recruitment trend would suggest a higher value of $M$. Inspecting the age-composition profiles by fleet reveals that most of the information is coming from the survey lengths (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:pinerplotmss)). Another important observation is that while the length data suggests a higher value for $M$ than the MLE, it is still within reasonable bounds (~0.06) whereas the length data in the base model suggest an MLE for $M$ outside the tested bounds (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:mprofiless)). 

### Conclusions regarding M

Overall, given the framework of the base model, it is apparent that the current prior on $M$ is reinforcing the perception given by most of the data that $M$ is between 0.04 and 0.07, and that in the absence of this prior (or in the presence of a more generous prior) the best estimate for $M$ would be much higher in the base model. Investigations using an alternative model framework revealed that allow fishery selectivity to be asymptotic results in $M$ values similar to the base case MLE, even in the presence of a broad prior. 

There is considerable conflict between likelihood components regarding the best estimate for $M$. A visual inspection of the data reveals that the fishery length compositions appear nearly stable through time, while the age compositions from both sources appear to track cohorts to a greater degree.  

The decision to implement the FishLife prior is likely advisable given the life history information and representation of uncertainty therein, though this decision should not be made without concurrently revisiting the treatment of selectivity, and potential re-weighting of fishery length composition data.

## Priors & Penalties on *F*, $\sigma_R$
Cadigan: *"Consider removing priors for $F$ Regularity and $\sigma_R$."*

The "prior for $F$ Regularity" a term that penalizes the vector of $F$ deviations using the sum-of-squares (in practice, assuming a mean of 0 and a variance of 1).  $\sigma_R$ is indeed estimated using a lognormally-distributed prior( $\sigma_R \sim lN(1.7,0.2)$). We addressed this comment by separately disabling each of these functions; additionally, the SS model mentioned above does not involve a prior on  $\sigma_R$ nor a penalty for $F$, so comparisons can be made among model frameworks for further information.

Disabling the penalty on  $\sigma_R$ did not result in changes to biomass trajectories (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:biomasssigr)).

Removing the penalty on $F$ did result in changes to the biomass trajectories, such that the sensitivity run estimated $F$ to be lower and the overall biomass to be higher in the absence of a penalty (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:biomassf)). The SS model, by comparison, estimates $F$ to be higher than both ADMB models yet the trajectory is similar (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:ftraj)).
