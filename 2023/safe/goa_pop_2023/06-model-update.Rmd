# Analytical approach

> Operational Update: The data description for POP has been truncated to
> highlight relevant updates or changes made for this cycle. The reader
> is referred to the last full assessment (Hulson et al., 2021) for the
> entirety of this section.

## General Model Structure

The model used for this Operational Update is unchanged from 2021. The
POP assessment is a single-sex, age-structured statistical catch-at-age
model written in AD Model Builder software (see Fournier et al. 2012 for
recent reference) as described in Courtney et al. (2007). Formulae for
the population dynamics, observation, and likelihood components of the
assessment model are presented in [Appendix 10d](#appxeqs).

## Description of Alternative Models

Given the change in lead authorship and results of the CIE review, this
model is an Update: the configuration matches the accepted model from
2021, with updated data. A full revision to the modeling framework is
anticipated in the next cycle. Therefore, there are no alternative
models presented here.

## Parameters Estimated Outside the Assessment Model

Values estimated outside the assessment include the parameters of the
values of the von Bertalanffy growth curve ($L_\infty$, $\kappa$, and
$t_0$), intercept and slope parameters for a regression of length
uncertainty versus age, and weight-at-age parameters ($w_\infty$, used
to specify size-to-age transition matrices for the 1960s-1970s are
unchanged. The values used to specify size-to-age transition matrices
for the 1980s onwards are updated using new age and length data from the
trawl survey.

Similarly, weight-at-age

A comparison of these values is as follows:

## Parameters Estimated Inside the Assessment Model

There is no change to the parameters estimated inside the assessment
model (see table below).

Three parameters are estimated with priors: Natural Mortality
($M \sim N(0.0661,0.00661)$), catchability ($q \sim N(1, 0.45)$), and
the uncertainty in recruitment deviations ($\sigma_r \sim N(1.7,0.11)$).

As before, fishery selectivity across four time periods transitions from
an asymptotic selectivity from 1961-1976 into dome-shaped fishery
selectivity after 1977. We fitted a logistic curve for the first block,
an averaged logistic-gamma in the 2nd block, and a gamma function for
the 3rd and 4th blocks. Bottom trawl survey selectivity is estimated to
be asymptotic with the logistic curve.

Maturity-at-age is modeled with the logistic function conditionally
within the assessment following the method presented in Hulson et al.
(2011). Parameter estimates for maturity-at-age are obtained by fitting
two datasets collected on female POP maturity from Lunsford (1999) and
Conrath and Knoth (2013). Parameters for the logistic function
describing maturity-at-age are estimated conditionally in the model so
that uncertainty in model results (e.g., ABC) can be linked to
uncertainty in maturity parameter estimates.

# Model Uncertainty

Evaluation of model uncertainty is obtained through a Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) algorithm (Gelman et al. 1995). The chain length of the
MCMC was 10,000,000 and was thinned to one iteration out of every 2,000.
We omit the first 1,000,000 iterations to allow for a burn-in period. We
use these MCMC methods to provide further evaluation of uncertainty in
the results below including 95% credible intervals for some parameters
(computed as the 5th and 95th percentiles of the MCMC samples).
