# Selected Model Results

> Operational Update: This section has been condensed to follow the newest guidelines for "Operational Update Assessments" to the best of the Authors' ability. A minimal set of figures and tables are provided here; links to electronic files for supplementary data (e.g., numbers-at-age from the base model) are included in-text.

The model used in this assessment is the same as the model accepted in 2021 with updated data and parameter priors. Model 20.1 with data updated through 2023 generally results in reasonable fits to the data, estimates biologically plausible parameters, and produces consistent patterns in abundance compared to previous assessments. The assessment model continues to underestimate the trawl biomass since the 2013 survey, though the retrospective pattern indicates that the model fit is continuing to improve to the trawl survey with additional assessments.

## Model Evaluation

### Residual Analysis and Convergence Criteria

The model achieved convergence as defined by an invertible Hessian matrix and a low maximum gradient component (`1e-4`). Time-series plots of observed and predicted values, and the time-series of recruitment deviations, did not suggest unusual residual patterns. The uncertainty around parameter estimates (obtained via MCMC, see below) and related derived quantities were in line with previous models.

### Parameter Estimates and Parameter Uncertainty 

The following table lists all estimated parameters in the base model. It includes the associated asymptotic standard error estimates or other statistical measures of uncertainty.  Time series of deviation parameters (fishing mortality rates $F$ for 1961-`r this_year` and recruitment deviations from 1935-`r this year`) are shown in figures 10.\@ref(fig:biorecfcompare) and 10.\@ref(fig:recdevs), respectively.

From the MCMC chains described in [Model Uncertainty](#modeluncertainty), we summarize the posterior densities of key parameters for the recommended model using histograms (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:hists)) and credible intervals (Table 10.\@ref(tab:parposteriorst)). We also use these posterior distributions to show uncertainty around time series estimates of survey biomass (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:survey)), total and spawning biomass, fully selected fishing mortality and recruitment (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:biofreccompare)).

Table 10.\@ref(tab:parposteriorst) shows the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of key parameters with their corresponding standard deviation derived from the Hessian matrix. Also shown are the MCMC, mean, median, standard deviation and the corresponding Bayesian 95% credible intervals (BCI). The Hessian and MCMC standard deviations are similar for q, M, and F40%, but the MCMC standard deviations are larger for the estimates of female spawning biomass and ABC. These larger standard deviations indicate that these parameters are more uncertain than indicated by the Hessian approximation. The distributions of these parameters with the exception of natural mortality are slightly skewed with higher means than medians for current spawning biomass and ABC, indicating possibilities of higher biomass estimates (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:biomasstraj)). 

<!-- Uncertainty estimates in the time series of spawning biomass also result in a skewed distribution towards higher values, particularly at the end of the time series and into the 15 year projected times series (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:ssbproj)). -->

Likelihood profiles for $M$ and $R_0$ are provided in XX.

### Time Series Results
*Definitions:* Spawning biomass is the biomass estimate of mature females. Total biomass is the biomass estimate of all POP age two and greater. Recruitment is measured as the number of age two POP. Fishing mortality is the mortality at the age the fishery has fully selected the fish. 

Key results have been summarized in Table  \@ref(tab:timeseriest). Model predictions generally fit the data well (Figures 10.\@ref(fig:catch) through 10.\@ref(fig:survey))) and most parameter estimates and likelihood functions have remained similar to the last several years using this model (Figure \@ref(fig:biorecfcompare) and Table 10.\@ref(tab:resultscompare)).

#### Biomass

Estimated total biomass gradually increased from a low near 85,000 t in 1980 to over 596,000 t at the peak in 2015 (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:biorecfcompare)). MCMC credible intervals indicate that the historic low is reasonably certain while recent increases are not quite as certain. Spawning biomass shows a similar trend (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:biorecfcompare)). These estimates show a rapid increase since 1992, which coincides with an increase in uncertainty. The recent estimates of spawning biomass are nearly at historical levels prior to the 1970s. Age of 50% selection is 5 for the survey and between 7 and 9 years for the fishery (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:selex)). Fish are fully selected by both fishery and survey between 10 and 15. Current fishery selectivity is dome-shaped and with the addition of the recent time block after 2007 matches well with the ages caught by the fishery. Catchability is slightly larger (1.82) than that estimated in 2020 (1.8). The high catchability for POP is supported by several empirical studies using line transect densities counted from a submersible compared to trawl survey densities (Krieger 1993 [$q$=2.1], Krieger and Sigler 1996 [$q$=1.3], Jones et al. 2021 [$q$=1.15]). Compared to the last full assessment, spawning biomass and age-6+ total biomass has increased in response to fitting the large trawl survey biomass estimates since 2013 (Table 10\@ref(tab:survobs), Figure 10.\@ref(fig:survey)).

#### Fishing Mortality

Figure \@ref(fig:spr) illustrates the estimated fishing mortality versus estimated spawning stock biomass (phase-plane plot), including applicable OFL and maximum FABC definitions for the stock, including 2 years of projected $F$ and $B$.

Fully-selected fishing mortality shows that fishing mortality has decreased dramatically from historic rates and has leveled out in the last decade (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:frate)). Goodman et al. (2002) suggested that stock assessment authors use a “management path” graph as a way to evaluate management and assessment performance over time. We chose to plot a phase plane plot of fishing mortality to $F_{OFL}$ ($F_{35}$%) and the estimated spawning biomass relative to unfished spawning biomass ($B_{100}$%). Harvest control rules based on $F_{35}$% and $F_{40}$% and the tier 3b adjustment are provided for reference. The management path for POP has been above the F35% adjusted limit for most of the historical time series (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:spr)). In addition, since 2004, POP SSB has been above $B_{40}$% and fishing mortality has been below F40% since 1983. 

#### Selectivity
The estimated selectivity curves are shown in Figure (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:selex)). The descending limb of the second-to-last time block (ending in 2006) is somewhat more domed (lower values) than the previous model, but the curves are otherwise similar.

#### Recruitment


Recruitment (as measured by age 2 fish) for POP is highly variable and large recruitments comprise much of the biomass for future years (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:recruitment)). Recruitment has increased since the early 1970s, starting with the 1986 year class. Since the 1990s there have been several larger than average year classes, with the largest resulting in 2006. The largest differences in estimated recruitment between the current assessment and the 2020 assessment resulted at the end of the time series (Table  10.\@ref(tab:timeseriest) and Figure 10.\@ref(fig:recruitment)), which should not be unexpected given the influence of additional age composition data on recent recruitment estimates. The survey age data and the large 2013-2019 survey biomass suggests that the 2006-2009, 2010, 2012, and 2016 year classes may be above average (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:recdevs)). However, these recent recruitments are still highly uncertain as indicated by the MCMC credible intervals in Figure 10.\@ref(fig:recdevs). POP do not seem to exhibit much of a stock-recruitment relationship because large recruitments have occurred during periods of high and low biomass (Figure 10.\@ref(fig:biorecfcompare) and Table 10.\@ref(tab:timeseriest)). There is no explicit stock-recruitment relationship for POP in the model. The average annual recruitment in numbers spawned after 1976 is estimated to be `r prettyNum(round(exp(4.449)*1000,0), big.mark = ',')`.

### Retrospective and Historical Analysis

A within-model retrospective analysis of the recommended model was conducted for the last 10 years of the time-series by dropping data one year at a time. The revised Mohn’s “rho” statistic (Hanselman et al. 2013) in female spawning biomass was -0.153 (slightly smaller than the 2020 value of -0.16), indicating that the model increases the estimate of female spawning biomass in recent years as data is added to the assessment. The retrospective female spawning biomass and the relative difference in female spawning biomass from the model in the terminal year are shown in Figure 10.\@ref(fig:retrospective) (with 95% credible intervals from MCMC). In general the relative difference in female spawning biomass early in the time series is low, in recent years the increases in spawning biomass have been up to 30% compared to the terminal year. This result is not unexpected as given the large trawl survey biomass estimates since 2013; the model is responding to this data by increasing the estimates of biomass in each subsequent year.

A historical comparison comparing the estimated spawning biomass to the most recent full assessment is shown in Figure 10.\@ref(fig:biorecfcompare).
