# Data Gaps and Research Priorities
There is little information on early life history of POP and recruitment processes. A better understanding of juvenile distribution, habitat utilization, and species interactions would improve understanding of the processes that determine the productivity of the stock. In the SSC and Plan Team comments, as well as Appendix 9B, we outline and prioritize a number of model investigations that will be conducted over the course of the next few years to improve this assessment.
