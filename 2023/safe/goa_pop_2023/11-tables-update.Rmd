Note:  There were no foreign or joint venture catches after 1988. Catches prior to 1989 are landed catches only. Catches in 1989 and 1990 also include fish reported in weekly production reports as discarded by processors. Catches in 1991-2019 also include discarded fish, as determined through a  blend of weekly production reports and information from the domestic observer program. Definitions of terms: Catch defined as follows:  1977, all Sebastes rockfish for Japanese catch, and POP for catches of other nations; 1978, POP only; 1979-87, the 5 species comprising the POP complex; 1988-2019, POP. Quota defined as follows:  1977-86, optimum yield; 1987, target quota; 1988-2019 total allowable catch. Sources: Catch:  1977-84, Carlson et al. (1986); 1985-88, Pacific Fishery Information Network (PacFIN); 1989-2019, National Marine Fisheries Service, Alaska Region. ABC and Quota: 1977-1986 Karinen and Wing (1987); 1987-1990, Heifetz et al.
